## short description
We'll be using d3.js (and potential libraries that are based off of d3.js) and the Instagram API to analyze the user's profile - which contains both the content and interactions (likes and comments). Things that we want to visualize include

* activity over time
* correlation between number of likes and when photo was posted
* graph location of photos
* most popular location in terms of likes
* map followers to two degrees

## our PR release
When one uses social media, there is more than just sharing and reading what friends are up to. There is a lot of data associated with these interactions in social media. We believe that a lot of information can be extracted from this treasure trove. Breadcrumbs will provide intuitive insight via data visualization on Instagram content and interactions. Anyone from the average social butterfly to the savvy marketing director can utilize this to see a comprehensive, yet user-friendly view of their account - allowing them to gain vital insight.
