## short description
We'll be using Chart.js, angular-chart.js, and the Instagram API to analyze the user's profile, which contains both content and interactions (likes and comments). Currently, the application visualizes: 

* correlation between likes and time of day, filter, and post location
* activity over time
* tag usage

## our PR release
When one uses social media, there is more than just sharing and reading what friends are up to. There is a lot of data associated with these interactions in social media. We believe that a lot of information can be extracted from this treasure trove. Breadcrumbs will provide intuitive insight via data visualization on Instagram content and interactions. Anyone from the average social butterfly to the savvy marketing director can utilize this to see a comprehensive, yet user-friendly view of their account - allowing them to gain vital insight.
